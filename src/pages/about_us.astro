        <h1>ABOUT SAKURA FESTIVAL</h1>
        <div class="tekst1">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Committee of the Copenhagen Sakura Festival was established in February, 2008 to arrange the cultural event Copenhagen Sakura Festival with the help of the Japanese 
Embassy in Denmark, the Municipality of Copenhagen and other Japan-related cultural and private organizations.
The original idea came from the noble deed of donation of 200 cherry blossom (Sakura) trees by Mr. Seiichi Takaki, President of Andersen Institute of Bread & Life, the holding company of Andersen Group of Hiroshima City, and the employees of the company. 
The donated trees were planted in Langelinie Park. Mr. Takaki is Honorary Consul of Denmark and he was appointed to the honorable position of ambassador of H.C. Andersenâ€™s birthday in 2005.
